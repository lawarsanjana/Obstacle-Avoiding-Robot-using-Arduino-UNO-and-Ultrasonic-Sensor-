# Obstacle-Avoiding-Robot-using-Arduino-UNO-and-Ultrasonic-Sensor-
Obstacle-Avoiding-Robot-using-arduinoAn Obstacle Avoidance Robot is an intelligent robot, which can automatically sense and overcome obstacles on its path. It contains of a Microcontroller to process the data, and Ultrasonic sensors to detect the obstacles on its path.

Technologies used:This project will be using the following technology stack [S/w and H/w]:
    S/W:
        1. Arduino IDE
  
    H/W:
        1.	Arduino UNO
        2.	Ultrasonic Sensor
        3.	L298N Motor Driver
        4.	Chassis and Wheels
        5.	9V Battery, DC Motors.
        6.	Jumper Wires and Cable Connecting to Arduino.   

Modules:
        1. Designing of Device
        2. Test the Device
        3.  Development 
        4. Implementation
        5. Testing
        6. Maintenance

Applications-
    1]Obstacle avoiding robots can be used in almost all mobile robot navigation systems.
    2]They can be used for household work like automatic vacuum cleaning.
    3]They can also be used in dangerous environments, where human penetration could be fatal.
